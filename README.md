# Martial-Arts-Gym-App

## This project's purpose is to enchance the memoranda application which has been largely dormant since 2007.  The approach to this project was to reverse engineer the features and turn this into a martial arts gym application.  I was part of a group where we used Agile software development methodology with Scrum.  We did this project in a matter of 3 sprints that took over 7.5 weeks to complete. 

## My responsibilities during these sprints were: 
  - To stabilize the application.
  - Build login and registration system.
  - Updating GUI for gym registration and registered users management.
  - Fix build versioning from Gradle.

# Below is what the original software looked like.
## There was no login system and no way to manage registered users.

# Added a login window for employees of the gym to log into

## If the user logged in is of type ADMIN he would see additional register and manage buttons up top.
