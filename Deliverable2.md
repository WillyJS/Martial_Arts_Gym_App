## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/27HItU_4LIg

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Work was done on the preferences menu, as well as implementing login/registration functionality/GUI and backend classes/linking classes to database.
> System is now more secure.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Considering we completed our core objectives, we feel that we worked enough.  We finished our most important tasks.

**Would you say you met the customersâ€™ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We feel that we did meet the customer's expectations, as they can now login, register, and access a persistent set of scheduler events.
> This is in line with our stated Sprint goals.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, donâ€™t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes.  We completed the list of core features/functionality that we sought out to complete during the Sprint.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> We did not.  There are 2 remaining tasks which will be moved into the next Sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Due to our different schedules, some changes were made in a way that did not result in a smooth burndown chart.  We had periods of time
> where we could not consistently make commits.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, we did deliver business value.  We added new features, and made the system more secure.  The user can now create an account, and login to the system.
> The preferences menu also now has a more intuitive feel, less irrelevant and/or confusing options.  Tasks are now persistent, and they can be accessed on 
> different systems.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We can further hone our estimation methods, so that we can more accurately predict how much work will get done during our next Sprint.
> We also now know a little bit more about the software, and will be able to more efficiently make changes and implement new functionality.


**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We are motivated to move on to our final Sprint, and to get this project looking and operating according to the customer's specifications.
