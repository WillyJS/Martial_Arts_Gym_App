  ## Michael Padilla : 3 Meetings
  ### Meeting 1:
  1. What have you been working on?
I've been working on US#2, task 13. This is to make the calendar on the side panel more legible since the table is so small. The first thing I tackled was to figure out where this object was being created. I located areas of interest and increased the font size from 10 to 15.
  2. What do you plan on working on?
The next item to complete is to locate the area where the calendar object is added to the panel to display. This will help work backward and find the code that controls the table dimensions and scale that up.
  3. Do you foresee anything that will make it difficult for you to finish your work?
I do not have any impediments to making progress on this task at the moment.

  ### Meeting 2:
  1. What have you been working on?
Implementation of US2 Task 13 to improve legibility of the calendar in the Memoranda program. In particular the sizing of the fonts and rows and columns.
  2. What do you plan on working on? 
If there are no additional suggestions for improving the legibility of the calendar, then I will assist with the other user stories that are pending.
  3. Do you foresee anything that will make it difficult for you to finish your work? 
I do not expect to have any issues completing the work for this task.

  ### Meeting 3:
  1. What have you been working on?
I have taken a look at other changes made in the dev branch to make sure they do not affect functionality and opened the pull request to merge dev int the main branch for the final sprint 1 commit.
  2. What do you plan on working on?
The only items left to work on are the retrospective and sprint 2 planning.
  3. Do you foresee anything that will make it difficult for you to finish your work?
The sprint is complete so there will be no impediments to completing any work.

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/wsEO1ucqhls

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We have successfully as a team stabilized the user interface of Memoranda.  We have also begun to change the look of the program to fit a Gym scheduler application.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We all pitched in coming up and working on Tasks for the User Stories given. We did not run out of work before the sprint was over and we were able to complete our tasks within the timeframe.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We have met the customer's expectations for this sprint.  The software is no longer prone to crashing when  minimizing and or running in the background when it is closed.  We have also begun the process of transforming the software into a Gym scheduler.  These changes can be seen from the Splash screen to the buttons that navigate the user through the application.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes we have met the Sprint goal. All tasks added were completed.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> Yes we completed all Sprint user stories in our Sprint backlog. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Although we were a little head of the curve on the burndown chart we worked consistently to the end.  

**Did you deliver business value?**

> No, we did not. However the changes we made to the software are steps forward to providing a product that can be used by the customer.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We will try to communicate with each other better. We will also try to include user stories that have more of an impact on the overall requirements for the application.  We will also try to better estimate user story points.

> We also will improve our quality process for Github management with respect to the dev and master branches.The Git master will enforce code reviews prior to approving merges into the dev and master branch. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We feel confident that we can complete the work we set for ourselves and that together we can deliver on the requirements given.
